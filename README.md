## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

1. Facebook
    a) Infinite scroll
    b) Can make posts that have text, photos, or videos
    c) Videos section where it is just videos 
2. Instagram
    a) Infinite scroll
    b) "Discover" section where they share random videos and photos
3. Snapchat
    a) Share and edit photos with filters
    b) Section where you can upload your photos and anyone in the world can access it. User can scroll to other parts of the world and see what they upload
    
App idea:
    Social media app. Can make a profile, upload photos/videos. Main page is infinite scroll showing you pages you follow. There's a section that gives you random photos and videos to watch and the more you click on certain kinds of photos/videos it shows more of that kind. Can look at a world map and add photos/videos to your location as well as explore other locations around the world and their photos and videos. There's a section where it is just an infinite scroll of videos. 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

My main issue for a bit was not knowing where exactly to put the code when connecting the logic to the UI. But after a bit of research I found out where I was putting it was wrong and I now have it in the correct place and the app is working as it should.
